##**Data Wrangling**
## We will now data wrangle the BikeSeoul.csv

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
BikeSeoul <- read_csv("~/Year 3/MT5763/BikeSeoul.csv")
  View(BikeSeoul)
BikeWashington <- read_csv("~/Year 3/MT5763/BikeWashingtonDC.csv")
```

```{r BikeSeoul}

  filter(!is.na(`Rented Bike Count`))
View(BikeSeoul)

  rename(Count = `Rented Bike Count`) %>%

BikeSeoul$Holiday <- ifelse(BikeSeoul$Holiday == "No Holiday", "No", "Yes")
yes_no_levels <- c("Yes", "No")

BikeSeoul <- BikeSeoul %>%
  order(Season, method = season_levels) %>%

#order(Season, method = season_levels)

```
```{r BikeWashington}

BikeWashington <- BikeWashington %>%
  mutate(BikeWashington, FullDate = make_datetime(year = year(Date), month = month(Date), day = mday(Date), Hour))
```
#**Data Visualisation**
##How does air temperature vary over the course of a year?
```{r, include= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
